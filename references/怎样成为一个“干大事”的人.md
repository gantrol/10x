[How to Do Great Work (paulgraham.com)](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html)

2023年7月 

如果你收集了各个领域“干大事”的技巧列表，其交集看起来会是什么样子？为了找出答案，我决定自己做。

这样做的部分原因是想创造一个可以被任何领域的人使用的指南。但我也对交集的形状感到好奇。这项练习显示，它确实有一个明确的形状；它不仅仅是一个“努力工作”的标签。

下述方法会假设你非常有抱负。[^long]

## 1 要从事什么

第一步是决定要从事什么。你所选择的需要有三个标准：你对它有天赋，你对它有浓厚的兴趣，并且它有提供“干大事”的可能。

实际上，你不需要太担心第三个标准。在这方面，有抱负的人往往对它过于保守。所以你只需要找到一些你有天赋并且非常感兴趣的东西。[^1]

这听起来很简单，但通常是非常困难的。当你还年轻的时候，你不知道自己擅长什么，也不知道不同类型的工作是什么样子。你最终做的某些工作可能现在还不存在。所以，尽管有些人在14岁的时候就知道他们想做什么，大多数人还需要去探索。

确定从事什么工作的方法，就是工作。如果你不确定应该做什么，就猜。但一定要选定某个方向并开始行动。有些时候，你可能会猜错，但这没关系——了解多方面的事物是有好处的；一些最大的发现来自于注意到不同领域之间的联系。

养成在“自己的”项目上工作的习惯。不要让“工作”意味着其他人告诉你该做的事。如果有一天你真“干了大事”，那很可能是在你“自己的”项目上。它可能是某个更大项目的一部分，但会是你自己驱动你那一部分。

你的项目应该是什么呢？任何对你来说感觉有雄心壮志的事情都可以。随着你年龄的增长和你对项目的兴趣的演化，令人兴奋的和重要的事将会重合。在7岁的时候，用乐高搭建巨大的东西可能会让你觉得雄心壮志；然后在14岁的时候，自学微积分；到了21岁，你开始探索物理学中尚未解答的问题。（虽然事情不同，）但始终保持对事物的兴奋感。

有一种近乎痴迷的好奇心，既是“干大事”的动力，又是方向盘[^rubber]。它不仅会推动你，如果你允许它发挥作用，它也会向你展示应该从事什么工作。

![英国海岸线到底有多长？](/assets/Coast_of_Britain.png)

你“超级好奇”什么——好奇到让很多人厌烦？这就是你要找的。

一旦你找到了你“超级好奇”的东西，下一步就是学习足够的知识，使你能够接触到知识的前沿。知识的拓展方式就像地图海岸线[^fractal]，从远处看，它的边缘看起来很平滑，但一旦你学习足够多，接近其中一个边缘，你会发现它充满了缺口。

下一步就是注意到这些缺口。这需要一些技巧，因为你的大脑希望忽略这些缺口，以便构建一个更简单的世界模型。对大家都视为理所当然的事情提出疑问，是许多发现的来源。[^2]

如果答案看起来很奇怪，那就更好了。伟大的工作通常有一丝奇怪。你可以从绘画跟数学领域看出这点。如果你故意搞得奇怪，那么当然会很做作，但如果它出现了，就接纳它吧。

大胆追逐那些“超纲”的想法，即便其他人对它不感兴趣——哦，改正一下，“尤其是其他人对它不感兴趣”。如果你对某种可能性感兴趣，其他人都忽视它，而你有足够的专业知识来精确说明他们忽视的是什么。那么，这将是你能找到的最好机会。[^3]

### 四个步骤

这就是几乎所有“干大事”的人所做的，从画家到物理学家：

1. 选择一个领域
2. 学习足够的知识进入前沿
3. 注意差距
4. 探索有前途的领域

第二步和第四步需要努力工作。虽然没有严格证明，但经验表明“干大事”一定要努力工作，就像死亡一样。这就是为什么要从事你感兴趣的方向。兴趣会驱使你，比起单纯的勤奋，还会更努力些。

最强大的三个动机是好奇、乐趣和做出令人钦佩之事的渴求。有时，它们会汇聚在一起，那种组合是最强大的。

最大的奖励是找到所有“地图”都没有的“海岸线”[^bud]。你注意到知识表面上的一个裂缝，把它撬开，里面就是一个全新的世界。

## 2 选择困难？兴趣优先

让我们深入谈谈从事什么工作这一复杂问题。这很难的主要原因是，对于大多数工作，你无法知道它是什么样的，除非去做。这意味着这四个步骤是重叠的：你可能需要在某项工作上工作数年，才能知道自己有多喜欢或擅长这项工作。而在此期间，你并没有从事大多数其他类型的工作，因此也就无法了解这些工作。因此，在最坏的情况下，根据非常不完整的信息，你可能很晚才知道怎么选择自己喜欢的工作。[^4]

抱负的性质会加剧这个问题。抱负可分两种，一种在对该领域感兴趣之前产生，另一种从兴趣中产生。大多数“干大事”的人两种都有，但如果前面一种越多，要决定做什么就越难。

大多数国家的教育系统假装这个问题很容易解决。他们期望你在你能了解它究竟是什么样子之前就致力于一个领域。因此，如果一个有抱负的人在最佳发展路径上，那么系统通常会把他看成问题的实例。

如果他们至少承认这一点会更好——承认系统不仅无法帮助你弄清楚应该从事什么工作，而且是在假设你神奇般地作为一个青少年就能猜到的前提下设计的。他们不会告诉你，但我会:当涉及到弄清楚应该从事什么工作时，你需要靠自己。一些人幸运地猜对了，但其他人会发现自己正横向穿过为所有人设计的直线轨道。

你是不是年轻且有抱负，但不知道要从事什么？你不应该被动地随波逐流，假设问题会随时间消失。你需要采取行动。但你不依赖不了任何系统化的程序。当你读“干大事”的人的传记时，你会发现运气起了很大的作用。他们怎么发现要从事的方向呢？可能是一次偶然的会面，或碰巧读到的一本书。所以，你需要让自己成为运气的大目标[^big target]，做到这一点的方法是保持好奇心。尝试许多事物，遇到许多人，阅读许多书籍，提出许多问题。[^5]

当感到疑惑时，让你感兴趣的领域优先。领域随着你对它们了解的深入而改变。例如，数学家做的事情与你在高中数学课上做的截然不同。因此，你需要给不同类型的工作一个机会，让它们展示它们的特点。但是，当你对一个领域的了解越深入，它应该变得越来越有趣。如果不是这样，那可能就不适合你。

不要担心自己的兴趣与他人不同。你感兴趣的领域越奇特、越好。奇特的偏好往往是强烈的偏好，对工作的强烈偏好意味着你将有很高生产效率。而且，在鲜有关注的地方，你更可能找到新事物。

你适合某种工作的一个迹象是，你喜欢其他人认为乏味或恐怖的部分。

但是，领域并非人[^not people]；你没有忠于这些领域的义务。如果你在从事某项工作的过程中发现了另一个更吸引你的，不要害怕改变。

如果你正在为人们创造某些东西，确保它是他们真正想要的。做到这一点的最好方法是制作你自己想要的东西。写你想读的故事；开发你想使用的工具。由于你的朋友可能有类似的兴趣，这也将帮助你获得初始受众。

这应该是兴趣[^excitingness]规则的延伸。显然，你最想写的故事会是你最想读的故事。我特别提起这个的原因是，很多人都做错了。他们并没有创作他们想要的，而是尝试创作一些虚构的、更复杂的观众想要的东西。一旦你走上这条路，你就迷失了。[^6]

当你试图找出要做什么时，有很多力量会让你迷失方向。自负、时尚、恐惧，金钱，政治，他人的愿望，不实的共识[^frauds]。但如果你坚持自己真正感兴趣的东西，你就能抵抗所有。如果你感兴趣，你就不会迷失。


## 3 胆量与计划

追随你的兴趣可能听起来像一种相当被动的策略，但在实践中，它通常意味着你需要勇敢地越过各种各样的障碍。你通常需要冒着被拒绝和失败的风险。因此，这确实很大的胆量。

虽然你需要胆量，但你通常不需要过多的计划。在大多数情况下，“干大事”的秘诀很简单：在令人兴奋的、雄心勃勃的项目上努力工作，好事自来。你只需要努力保持特定因素，而不是制定一个计划然后去执行。

计划的问题在于，你首先要知道你的成果是什么。你可以通过在孩提时期决定赢得金牌或者致富，然后坚持追求这个目标，但你不能用这种方式发现自然选择。

我认为，对于大多数想要“干大事”的人来说，正确的策略不是过多地计划。在每个阶段，做最有趣的事情，并为未来留下最好的选择。我称这种方法为“顺势而为”[^upwind]。这是大多数“干大事”的人采取的方式。

## 4 工作避坑指南

即使你找到了令人兴奋的工作，工作起来也并非那么顺利。有时，某个新想法会让你一早人床分离，直接投入工作。但也有很多时候，事情并非如此。

你一扬帆，灵感就推你前行？这不现实。像航海一样，路上会有逆风、潮流和暗礁，也就都要有一套技巧。

例如，虽然你必须努力工作，但可能会努力过度，如果这样，你会发现你得到的回报越来越少：疲劳会让你变蠢，最终甚至可能损害你的健康。工作产生收益递减的点取决于工作的类型。最艰难的那些，你可能一天只能做四到五个小时。

理想情况下，这些工作时段应该是连续的。因此，尽可能地安排你的生活，让你有大块的时间去工作。如果你知道你可能会被打断，你会回避困难的任务。

开始工作可能比继续工作更难。你经常需要骗自己，以便越过那个初始阈值。不要为此担忧；这是工作的性质，而不是你性格上的缺陷。工作有一种激活能量，既有每天的，也有每个项目的。而且，由于这个阈值是虚假的（它比保持工作所需的能量高），为了越过它，用一个同等程度的谎言骗自己，是没问题的。[^just one]

如果你想“干大事”，骗自己通常是一个错误，但这是其中的罕见例外。当我在早晨不愿意开始工作的时候，我常常骗自己说：“我就看看我做到哪了。”五分钟后，我发现了一些看起来错误或不完整的地方，然后我就停不下来了。

类似的技巧对于启动新项目也有效。比如，骗自己说，某个项目投入没那么大——很多大事，始于“这没多难吧？”

这是年轻人具有优势的一个例子。他们更乐观，尽管他们乐观的一个源头是无知，但在这种情况下，无知胜知识。

尽管如此，你尽量要完成你开始的事情，即使它比你预期的工作量要大。完成事情不仅仅是有序性或自律性的一种锻炼。在许多项目中，很多最棒的工作发生在最后阶段。

另一个可许的谎言是夸大你正在做的事情的重要性，至少你这样认为。如果这有助于你发现新事物，那么“谎言”成真。[^7]

Since there are two senses of starting work — per day and per project — there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project procrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off starting that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn't quite right. When you're procrastinating in units of years, you can get a lot not done. [^8]

One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it usually camouflages itself as work. You're not just sitting around doing nothing; you're working industriously on something else. So per-project procrastination doesn't set off the alarms that per-day procrastination does. You're too busy to notice it.

The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I working on what I most want to work on?" When you're young it's ok if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous as you get older. [^9]

## 6

Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can't think of this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the work sufficiently engaging as it's happening.

There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years at things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not how great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you're genuinely interested in. When you pause to take stock, you're surprised how far you've come.

The reason we're surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative effect of work. Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but if you do it every day you'll write a book a year. That's the key: consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing.

If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most people who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon: the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more. Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more new fans they'll bring you.

The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the beginning. It isn't; it's still a wonderful exponential curve. But we can't grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential growth in its early stages.

Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it's worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since we underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase of learning something new because they know from experience that learning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their audience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do. If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential growth, many more would do it.

## 6

Work doesn't just happen when you're trying to. There's a kind of undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a little, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by frontal attack.

You have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this phenomenon, though. You can't just walk around daydreaming. The daydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate work that feeds it questions. [^10]

Everyone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it's also important to avoid them in the other half of the cycle. When you let your mind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at that moment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out of the top spot, or you'll waste this valuable type of thinking on the distraction instead. (Exception: Don't avoid love.)

## 7

Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't know what you're aiming for.

And that *is* what you're aiming for, because if you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good. This observation has been made by so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth thinking about why it's true. It could be because ambition is a phenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction — where almost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short. Or it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively different thing from ambition to be good. Or maybe being good is simply too vague a standard. Probably all three are true. [^11]

Fortunately there's a kind of economy of scale here. Though it might seem like you'd be taking on a heavy burden by trying to be the best, in practice you often end up net ahead. It's exciting, and also strangely liberating. It simplifies things. In some ways it's easier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good.

One way to aim high is to try to make something that people will care about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions matter more than your contemporaries', but because something that still seems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good.

## 8

Don't try to work in a distinctive style. Just try to do the best job you can; you won't be able to help doing it in a distinctive way.

Style is doing things in a distinctive way without trying to. Trying to is affectation.

Affectation is in effect to pretend that someone other than you is doing the work. You adopt an impressive but fake persona, and while you're pleased with the impressiveness, the fakeness is what shows in the work. [^12]

The temptation to be someone else is greatest for the young. They often feel like nobodies. But you never need to worry about that problem, because it's self-solving if you work on sufficiently ambitious projects. If you succeed at an ambitious project, you're not a nobody; you're the person who did it. So just do the work and your identity will take care of itself.

## 9

"Avoid affectation" is a useful rule so far as it goes, but how would you express this idea positively? How would you say what to be, instead of what not to be? The best answer is earnest. If you're earnest you avoid not just affectation but a whole set of similar vices.

The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We're taught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue — as a kind of sacrifice. But in fact it's a source of power too. To see new ideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You're trying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how can you have a sharp eye for the truth if you're intellectually dishonest?

One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight positive pressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willing to admit that you're mistaken. Once you've admitted you were mistaken about something, you're free. Till then you have to carry it. [^13]

Another more subtle component of earnestness is informality. Informality is much more important than its grammatically negative name implies. It's not merely the absence of something. It means focusing on what matters instead of what doesn't.

What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as doing the work, you're trying to seem a certain way as you're doing it. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being good. That's one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work: they expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that's basically the definition of a nerd.

Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that's exactly what you need in doing great work. It's not learned; it's preserved from childhood. So hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather than the one who sits back and offers sophisticated-sounding criticisms of them. "It's easy to criticize" is true in the most literal sense, and the route to great work is never easy.

There may be some jobs where it's an advantage to be cynical and pessimistic, but if you want to do great work it's an advantage to be optimistic, even though that means you'll risk looking like a fool sometimes. There's an old tradition of doing the opposite. The Old Testament says it's better to keep quiet lest you look like a fool. But that's advice for *seeming* smart. If you actually want to discover new things, it's better to take the risk of telling people your ideas.

Some people are naturally earnest, and with others it takes a conscious effort. Either kind of earnestness will suffice. But I doubt it would be possible to do great work without being earnest. It's so hard to do even if you are. You don't have enough margin for error to accommodate the distortions introduced by being affected, intellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable, or cool. [^14]

## 10

Great work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself. It's usually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middle of working on something, ask which choice is more consistent.

You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won't necessarily have to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some effort; when there's something you need to redo, status quo bias and laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat this ask: If I'd already made the change, would I want to revert to what I have now?

Have the confidence to cut. Don't keep something that doesn't fit just because you're proud of it, or because it cost you a lot of effort.

Indeed, in some kinds of work it's good to strip whatever you're doing to its essence. The result will be more concentrated; you'll understand it better; and you won't be able to lie to yourself about whether there's anything real there.

Mathematical elegance may sound like a mere metaphor, drawn from the arts. That's what I thought when I first heard the term "elegant" applied to a proof. But now I suspect it's conceptually prior — that the main ingredient in artistic elegance is mathematical elegance. At any rate it's a useful standard well beyond math.

Elegance can be a long-term bet, though. Laborious solutions will often have more prestige in the short term. They cost a lot of effort and they're hard to understand, both of which impress people, at least temporarily.

Whereas some of the very best work will seem like it took comparatively little effort, because it was in a sense already there. It didn't have to be built, just seen. It's a very good sign when it's hard to say whether you're creating something or discovering it.

When you're doing work that could be seen as either creation or discovery, err on the side of discovery. Try thinking of yourself as a mere conduit through which the ideas take their natural shape.

(Strangely enough, one exception is the problem of choosing a problem to work on. This is usually seen as search, but in the best case it's more like creating something. In the best case you create the field in the process of exploring it.)

Similarly, if you're trying to build a powerful tool, make it gratuitously unrestrictive. A powerful tool almost by definition will be used in ways you didn't expect, so err on the side of eliminating restrictions, even if you don't know what the benefit will be.

Great work will often be tool-like in the sense of being something others build on. So it's a good sign if you're creating ideas that others could use, or exposing questions that others could answer. The best ideas have implications in many different areas.

If you express your ideas in the most general form, they'll be truer than you intended.

## 11

True by itself is not enough, of course. Great ideas have to be true and new. And it takes a certain amount of ability to see new ideas even once you've learned enough to get to one of the frontiers of knowledge.

In English we give this ability names like originality, creativity, and imagination. And it seems reasonable to give it a separate name, because it does seem to some extent a separate skill. It's possible to have a great deal of ability in other respects — to have a great deal of what's often called "technical ability" — and yet not have much of this.

I've never liked the term "creative process." It seems misleading. Originality isn't a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkers throw off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an angle grinder throwing off sparks. They can't help it.

If the thing they're focused on is something they don't understand very well, these new ideas might not be good. One of the most original thinkers I know decided to focus on dating after he got divorced. He knew roughly as much about dating as the average 15 year old, and the results were spectacularly colorful. But to see originality separated from expertise like that made its nature all the more clear.

I don't know if it's possible to cultivate originality, but there are definitely ways to make the most of however much you have. For example, you're much more likely to have original ideas when you're working on something. Original ideas don't come from trying to have original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something slightly too difficult. [^15]

Talking or writing about the things you're interested in is a good way to generate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, a missing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you. Indeed, there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing.

Changing your context can help. If you visit a new place, you'll often find you have new ideas there. The journey itself often dislodges them. But you may not have to go far to get this benefit. Sometimes it's enough just to go for a walk. [^16]

It also helps to travel in topic space. You'll have more new ideas if you explore lots of different topics, partly because it gives the angle grinder more surface area to work on, and partly because analogies are an especially fruitful source of new ideas.

Don't divide your attention *evenly* between many topics though, or you'll spread yourself too thin. You want to distribute it according to something more like a power law. [^17] Be professionally curious about a few topics and idly curious about many more.

Curiosity and originality are closely related. Curiosity feeds originality by giving it new things to work on. But the relationship is closer than that. Curiosity is itself a kind of originality; it's roughly to questions what originality is to answers. And since questions at their best are a big component of answers, curiosity at its best is a creative force.

## 12

Having new ideas is a strange game, because it usually consists of seeing things that were right under your nose. Once you've seen a new idea, it tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this before?

When an idea seems simultaneously novel and obvious, it's probably a good one.

Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having new ideas is hard. What's the source of this apparent contradiction? It's that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the way you look at the world. We see the world through models that both help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas become obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard. That's how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover: they're easy to see after you do something hard.

One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other people. Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues where they bash against reality. Most people don't want to see these clues. It would be an understatement to say that they're attached to their current model; it's what they think in; so they'll tend to ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however conspicuous it may seem in retrospect.

To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage instead of looking away. That's what Einstein did. He was able to see the wild implications of Maxwell's equations not so much because he was looking for new ideas as because he was stricter.

The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxical as it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps to be the sort of person who's comfortable breaking rules. From the point of view of the old model, which everyone including you initially shares, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules.

Few understand the degree of rule-breaking required, because new ideas seem much more conservative once they succeed. They seem perfectly reasonable once you're using the new model of the world they brought with them. But they didn't at the time; it took the greater part of a century for the heliocentric model to be generally accepted, even among astronomers, because it felt so wrong.

Indeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to most people, or someone would have already explored it. So what you're looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of crazy. How do you recognize these? You can't with certainty. Often ideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are the right kind of crazy tend to be exciting; they're rich in implications; whereas ideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing.

There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy breaking them, and to be indifferent to them. I call these two cases being aggressively and passively independent-minded.

The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules don't merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional energy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer audacity of a project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it started.

The other way to break rules is not to care about them, or perhaps even to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often make new discoveries; their ignorance of a field's assumptions acts as a source of temporary passive independent-mindedness. Aspies also seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs. Several I know say that this helps them to have new ideas.

Strictness plus rule-breaking sounds like a strange combination. In popular culture they're opposed. But popular culture has a broken model in this respect. It implicitly assumes that issues are trivial ones, and in trivial matters strictness and rule-breaking *are* opposed. But in questions that really matter, only rule-breakers can be truly strict.

## 13

An overlooked idea often doesn't lose till the semifinals. You do see it, subconsciously, but then another part of your subconscious shoots it down because it would be too weird, too risky, too much work, too controversial. This suggests an exciting possibility: if you could turn off such filters, you could see more new ideas.

One way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas for *someone else* to explore. Then your subconscious won't shoot them down to protect you.

You could also discover overlooked ideas by working in the other direction: by starting from what's obscuring them. Every cherished but mistaken principle is surrounded by a dead zone of valuable ideas that are unexplored because they contradict it.

Religions are collections of cherished but mistaken principles. So anything that can be described either literally or metaphorically as a religion will have valuable unexplored ideas in its shadow. Copernicus and Darwin both made discoveries of this type. [^18]

What are people in your field religious about, in the sense of being too attached to some principle that might not be as self-evident as they think? What becomes possible if you discard it?

## 14

People show much more originality in solving problems than in deciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly conservative when deciding what to work on. People who'd never dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on fashionable problems.

One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than solutions is that problems are bigger bets. A problem could occupy you for years, while exploring a solution might only take days. But even so I think most people are too conservative. They're not merely responding to risk, but to fashion as well. Unfashionable problems are undervalued.

One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is the problem that people think has been fully explored, but hasn't. Great work often takes something that already exists and shows its latent potential. Durer and Watt both did this. So if you're interested in a field that others think is tapped out, don't let their skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this.

Working on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There's no hype or hurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupied elsewhere. The existing work often has an old-school solidity. And there's a satisfying sense of economy in cultivating ideas that would otherwise be wasted.

But the most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitly unfashionable in the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn't seem to matter as much as it actually does. How do you find these? By being self-indulgent — by letting your curiosity have its way, and tuning out, at least temporarily, the little voice in your head that says you should only be working on "important" problems.

You do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone is too conservative about what counts as one. And if there's an important but overlooked problem in your neighborhood, it's probably already on your subconscious radar screen. So try asking yourself: if you were going to take a break from "serious" work to work on something just because it would be really interesting, what would you do? The answer is probably more important than it seems.

Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than originality in solving them. That's what distinguishes the people who discover whole new fields. So what might seem to be merely the initial step — deciding what to work on — is in a sense the key to the whole game.

## 15

Few grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas is about the ratio of question to answer in their composition. People think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight was in the question.

Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they're used in schools. In schools they tend to exist only briefly before being answered, like unstable particles. But a really good question can be much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery. How do new species arise? Is the force that makes objects fall to earth the same as the one that keeps planets in their orbits? By even asking such questions you were already in excitingly novel territory.

Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around with you. But the more you're carrying, the greater the chance of noticing a solution — or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing that two unanswered questions are the same.

Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often comes from returning to a question you first noticed years before — in your childhood, even — and couldn't stop thinking about. People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful dreams alive, but it's just as important to keep your youthful questions alive. [^19]

This is one of the places where actual expertise differs most from the popular picture of it. In the popular picture, experts are certain. But actually the more puzzled you are, the better, so long as (a) the things you're puzzled about matter, and (b) no one else understands them either.

Think about what's happening at the moment just before a new idea is discovered. Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled about something. Which means that originality consists partly of puzzlement — of confusion! You have to be comfortable enough with the world being full of puzzles that you're willing to see them, but not so comfortable that you don't want to solve them. [^20]

It's a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. And this is one of those situations where the rich get richer, because the best way to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones. Questions don't just lead to answers, but also to more questions.

## 16

The best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread protruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it just gets longer and longer. So don't require a question to be obviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict that. It's hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to predict how much will unravel if you pull on it.

It's better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit on a lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The initial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start lots of small things.

Being prolific is underrated. The more different things you try, the greater the chance of discovering something new. Understand, though, that trying lots of things will mean trying lots of things that don't work. You can't have a lot of good ideas without also having a lot of bad ones. [^21]

Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything that's been done before, you'll learn faster and have more fun by trying stuff. And you'll understand previous work better when you do look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier when starting means starting small; those two ideas fit together like two puzzle pieces.

How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By making successive versions. Great things are almost always made in successive versions. You start with something small and evolve it, and the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than anything you could have planned.

It's particularly useful to make successive versions when you're making something for people — to get an initial version in front of them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response.

Begin by trying the simplest thing that could possibly work. Surprisingly often, it does. If it doesn't, this will at least get you started.

Don't try to cram too much new stuff into any one version. There are names for doing this with the first version (taking too long to ship) and the second (the second system effect), but these are both merely instances of a more general principle.

An early version of a new project will sometimes be dismissed as a toy. It's a good sign when people do this. That means it has everything a new idea needs except scale, and that tends to follow. [^22]

The alternative to starting with something small and evolving it is to plan in advance what you're going to do. And planning does usually seem the more responsible choice. It sounds more organized to say "we're going to do x and then y and then z" than "we're going to try x and see what happens." And it is more *organized*; it just doesn't work as well.

Planning per se isn't good. It's sometimes necessary, but it's a necessary evil — a response to unforgiving conditions. It's something you have to do because you're working with inflexible media, or because you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If you keep projects small and use flexible media, you don't have to plan as much, and your designs can evolve instead.

## 17

Take as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk is proportionate to reward, so don't look for certainty, but for a bet with high expected value. If you're not failing occasionally, you're probably being too conservative.

Though conservatism is usually associated with the old, it's the young who tend to make this mistake. Inexperience makes them fear risk, but it's when you're young that you can afford the most.

Even a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of working on it, you'll have crossed territory few others have seen, and encountered questions few others have asked. And there's probably no better source of questions than the ones you encounter in trying to do something slightly too hard.

## 18

Use the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages of age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy, time, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge, efficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some of the latter when young and keep some of the former when old.

The old also have the advantage of knowing which advantages they have. The young often have them without realizing it. The biggest is probably time. The young have no idea how rich they are in time. The best way to turn this time to advantage is to use it in slightly frivolous ways: to learn about something you don't need to know about, just out of curiosity, or to try building something just because it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at something.

That "slightly" is an important qualification. Spend time lavishly when you're young, but don't simply waste it. There's a big difference between doing something you worry might be a waste of time and doing something you know for sure will be. The former is at least a bet, and possibly a better one than you think. [^23]

The most subtle advantage of youth, or more precisely of inexperience, is that you're seeing everything with fresh eyes. When your brain embraces an idea for the first time, sometimes the two don't fit together perfectly. Usually the problem is with your brain, but occasionally it's with the idea. A piece of it sticks out awkwardly and jabs you when you think about it. People who are used to the idea have learned to ignore it, but you have the opportunity not to. [^24]

So when you're learning about something for the first time, pay attention to things that seem wrong or missing. You'll be tempted to ignore them, since there's a 99% chance the problem is with you. And you may have to set aside your misgivings temporarily to keep progressing. But don't forget about them. When you've gotten further into the subject, come back and check if they're still there. If they're still viable in the light of your present knowledge, they probably represent an undiscovered idea.

## 19

One of the most valuable kinds of knowledge you get from experience is to know what you *don't* have to worry about. The young know all the things that could matter, but not their relative importance. So they worry equally about everything, when they should worry much more about a few things and hardly at all about the rest.

But what you don't know is only half the problem with inexperience. The other half is what you do know that ain't so. You arrive at adulthood with your head full of nonsense — bad habits you've acquired and false things you've been taught — and you won't be able to do great work till you clear away at least the nonsense in the way of whatever type of work you want to do.

Much of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools. We're so used to schools that we unconsciously treat going to school as identical with learning, but in fact schools have all sorts of strange qualities that warp our ideas about learning and thinking.

For example, schools induce passivity. Since you were a small child, there was an authority at the front of the class telling all of you what you had to learn and then measuring whether you did. But neither classes nor tests are intrinsic to learning; they're just artifacts of the way schools are usually designed.

The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you're still in school, try thinking of your education as your project, and your teachers as working for you rather than vice versa. That may seem a stretch, but it's not merely some weird thought experiment. It's the truth, economically, and in the best case it's the truth intellectually as well. The best teachers don't want to be your bosses. They'd prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a source of advice, rather than being pulled by them through the material.

Schools also give you a misleading impression of what work is like. In school they tell you what the problems are, and they're almost always soluble using no more than you've been taught so far. In real life you have to figure out what the problems are, and you often don't know if they're soluble at all.

But perhaps the worst thing schools do to you is train you to win by hacking the test. You can't do great work by doing that. You can't trick God. So stop looking for that kind of shortcut. The way to beat the system is to focus on problems and solutions that others have overlooked, not to skimp on the work itself.

## 20

Don't think of yourself as dependent on some gatekeeper giving you a "big break." Even if this were true, the best way to get it would be to focus on doing good work rather than chasing influential people.

And don't take rejection by committees to heart. The qualities that impress admissions officers and prize committees are quite different from those required to do great work. The decisions of selection committees are only meaningful to the extent that they're part of a feedback loop, and very few are.

## 21

People new to a field will often copy existing work. There's nothing inherently bad about that. There's no better way to learn how something works than by trying to reproduce it. Nor does copying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is the presence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones.

There's a good way to copy and a bad way. If you're going to copy something, do it openly instead of furtively, or worse still, unconsciously. This is what's meant by the famously misattributed phrase "Great artists steal." The really dangerous kind of copying, the kind that gives copying a bad name, is the kind that's done without realizing it, because you're nothing more than a train running on tracks laid down by someone else. But at the other extreme, copying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination. [^25]

In many fields it's almost inevitable that your early work will be in some sense based on other people's. Projects rarely arise in a vacuum. They're usually a reaction to previous work. When you're first starting out, you don't have any previous work; if you're going to react to something, it has to be someone else's. Once you're established, you can react to your own. But while the former gets called derivative and the latter doesn't, structurally the two cases are more similar than they seem.

Oddly enough, the very novelty of the most novel ideas sometimes makes them seem at first to be more derivative than they are. New discoveries often have to be conceived initially as variations of existing things, *even by their discoverers*, because there isn't yet the conceptual vocabulary to express them.

There are definitely some dangers to copying, though. One is that you'll tend to copy old things — things that were in their day at the frontier of knowledge, but no longer are.

And when you do copy something, don't copy every feature of it. Some will make you ridiculous if you do. Don't copy the manner of an eminent 50 year old professor if you're 18, for example, or the idiom of a Renaissance poem hundreds of years later.

Some of the features of things you admire are flaws they succeeded despite. Indeed, the features that are easiest to imitate are the most likely to be the flaws.

This is particularly true for behavior. Some talented people are jerks, and this sometimes makes it seem to the inexperienced that being a jerk is part of being talented. It isn't; being talented is merely how they get away with it.

One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from one field into another. History is so full of chance discoveries of this type that it's probably worth giving chance a hand by deliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideas from quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors.

Negative examples can be as inspiring as positive ones. In fact you can sometimes learn more from things done badly than from things done well; sometimes it only becomes clear what's needed when it's missing.

## 22

If a lot of the best people in your field are collected in one place, it's usually a good idea to visit for a while. It will increase your ambition, and also, by showing you that these people are human, increase your self-confidence. [^26]

If you're earnest you'll probably get a warmer welcome than you might expect. Most people who are very good at something are happy to talk about it with anyone who's genuinely interested. If they're really good at their work, then they probably have a hobbyist's interest in it, and hobbyists always want to talk about their hobbies.

It may take some effort to find the people who are really good, though. Doing great work has such prestige that in some places, particularly universities, there's a polite fiction that everyone is engaged in it. And that is far from true. People within universities can't say so openly, but the quality of the work being done in different departments varies immensely. Some departments have people doing great work; others have in the past; others never have.

## 23

Seek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can't be done alone, and even if you're working on one that can be, it's good to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off.

Colleagues don't just affect your work, though; they also affect you. So work with people you want to become like, because you will.

Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It's better to have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good ones. In fact it's not merely better, but necessary, judging from history: the degree to which great work happens in clusters suggests that one's colleagues often make the difference between doing great work and not.

How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues? In my experience, when you do, you know. Which means if you're unsure, you probably don't. But it may be possible to give a more concrete answer than that. Here's an attempt: sufficiently good colleagues offer *surprising* insights. They can see and do things that you can't. So if you have a handful of colleagues good enough to keep you on your toes in this sense, you're probably over the threshold.

Most of us can benefit from collaborating with colleagues, but some projects require people on a larger scale, and starting one of those is not for everyone. If you want to run a project like that, you'll have to become a manager, and managing well takes aptitude and interest like any other kind of work. If you don't have them, there is no middle path: you must either force yourself to learn management as a second language, or avoid such projects. [^27]

## 24

Husband your morale. It's the basis of everything when you're working on ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a living organism.

Morale starts with your view of life. You're more likely to do great work if you're an optimist, and more likely to if you think of yourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim.

Indeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. If you choose work that's pure, its very difficulties will serve as a refuge from the difficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism, it's a very productive form of it, and one that has been used by some of the greatest minds in history.

Morale compounds via work: high morale helps you do good work, which increases your morale and helps you do even better work. But this cycle also operates in the other direction: if you're not doing good work, that can demoralize you and make it even harder to. Since it matters so much for this cycle to be running in the right direction, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work when you're stuck, just so you start to get something done.

One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow setbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting. You can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering setbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always involves some backtracking.

Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the desire to. So "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again" isn't quite right. It should be: If at first you don't succeed, either try again, or backtrack and then try again.

"Never give up" is also not quite right. Obviously there are times when it's the right choice to eject. A more precise version would be: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you need to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.

It's not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any more than it's a bad sign to be out of breath while running. It depends how fast you're running. So learn to distinguish good pain from bad. Good pain is a sign of effort; bad pain is a sign of damage.

## 25

An audience is a critical component of morale. If you're a scholar, your audience may be your peers; in the arts, it may be an audience in the traditional sense. Either way it doesn't need to be big. The value of an audience doesn't grow anything like linearly with its size. Which is bad news if you're famous, but good news if you're just starting out, because it means a small but dedicated audience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of people genuinely love what you're doing, that's enough.

To the extent you can, avoid letting intermediaries come between you and your audience. In some types of work this is inevitable, but it's so liberating to escape it that you might be better off switching to an adjacent type if that will let you go direct. [^28]

The people you spend time with will also have a big effect on your morale. You'll find there are some who increase your energy and others who decrease it, and the effect someone has is not always what you'd expect. Seek out the people who increase your energy and avoid those who decrease it. Though of course if there's someone you need to take care of, that takes precedence.

Don't marry someone who doesn't understand that you need to work, or sees your work as competition for your attention. If you're ambitious, you need to work; it's almost like a medical condition; so someone who won't let you work either doesn't understand you, or does and doesn't care.

Ultimately morale is physical. You think with your body, so it's important to take care of it. That means exercising regularly, eating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds of drugs. Running and walking are particularly good forms of exercise because they're good for thinking. [^29]

People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone else, but they're happier than they'd be if they didn't. In fact, if you're smart and ambitious, it's dangerous *not* to be productive. People who are smart and ambitious but don't achieve much tend to become bitter.

## 26

It's ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people. The opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the opinion of a much larger group you might or might not respect, just adds noise.

The prestige of a type of work is at best a trailing indicator and sometimes completely mistaken. If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious. So the question to ask about a type of work is not how much prestige it has, but how well it could be done.

Competition can be an effective motivator, but don't let it choose the problem for you; don't let yourself get drawn into chasing something just because others are. In fact, don't let competitors make you do anything much more specific than work harder.

Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to.

## 27

Notice how often that word has come up. If you asked an oracle the secret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single word, my bet would be on "curiosity."

That doesn't translate directly to advice. It's not enough just to be curious, and you can't command curiosity anyway. But you can nurture it and let it drive you.

Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole process is a kind of dance with curiosity.

## 28

Believe it or not, I tried to make this essay as short as I could. But its length at least means it acts as a filter. If you made it this far, you must be interested in doing great work. And if so you're already further along than you might realize, because the set of people willing to want to is small.

The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal, mathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and luck. Luck by definition you can't do anything about, so we can ignore that. And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want to do great work. So the problem boils down to ability and interest. Can you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will combine to yield an explosion of new ideas?

Here there are grounds for optimism. There are so many different ways to do great work, and even more that are still undiscovered. Out of all those different types of work, the one you're most suited for is probably a pretty close match. Probably a comically close match. It's just a question of finding it, and how far into it your ability and interest can take you. And you can only answer that by trying.

Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds them back is a combination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuous to try to be Newton or Shakespeare. It also seems hard; surely if you tried something like that, you'd fail. Presumably the calculation is rarely explicit. Few people consciously decide not to try to do great work. But that's what's going on subconsciously; they shy away from the question.

So I'm going to pull a sneaky trick on you. Do you want to do great work, or not? Now you have to decide consciously. Sorry about that. I wouldn't have done it to a general audience. But we already know you're interested.

Don't worry about being presumptuous. You don't have to tell anyone. And if it's too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people have worse problems than that. In fact you'll be lucky if it's the worst problem you have.

Yes, you'll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have to work hard. And if you're working on something you find very interesting, which you necessarily will if you're on the right path, the work will probably feel less burdensome than a lot of your peers'.

The discoveries are out there, waiting to be made. Why not by you?

[^1]: 我不认为你可以给什么“干大事”下一个精确的定义。“干大事”是指把一件重要的事情做得很好，从而拓展了人们的想象空间。但重要性并没有具体阈值。这是一个程度问题，而且往往很难在当时做出判断。因此，我更希望人们专注于发展自己的兴趣，而不是担心它们是否重要。只要努力做一些了不起的事情，你是否成功这种事情，就留给后人去评价。

[^2]: 很多段子喜剧都是基于日常生活中的反常现象。“你有没有注意到……？”新的想法来自于对非小事（nontrival）的思考。这也许有助于解释为什么人们对一个新想法的反应往往是笑的前半部分：哈！

[^3]: “精确”是非常重要的。如果你对大多数权威不屑一顾的东西感到兴奋，但你又不能给出比“他们不明白”更精确的解释，那么你就开始进入怪人的行列了。

[^4]: 找到要从事什么的过程，并不是简单地将当前版本的你与一系列已知问题匹配起来。你经常需要和问题共同演变。这就是为什么有时候非常难弄清楚要做什么。搜索空间非常大。它是所有可能的工作类型（已知和尚未发现）和所有可能的未来版本的你的笛卡尔积。    你无法搜索整个空间，所以你必须启发式地生成有前景的路径，并希望最佳匹配会聚集。但它们并不总是这样；不同类型的工作被收集到一起，既有历史的偶然性，也由其内在相似性。

[^5]: 好奇心强的人更有可能做出伟大的作品，原因有很多，但其中一个更微妙的原因是，通过广撒网，他们更有可能在一开始就找到正确的工作。

[^6]: 如果这会导致你对他们说三道四的话，为你觉得不如你成熟的受众制作作品，是一件很危险的事情。如果你以足够cynical的方式去做，你可以赚很多钱，但这不是“做大事”的方式。当然，使用这种方法的人不会在意。[^mo]

[^7]: 这个观念是我从这学来的： Hardy's *A Mathematician's Apology*。我将它推荐给有志于“干大事”的人，任何领域。

### 5

[^8]: Just as we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do over several years, we overestimate the damage done by procrastinating for a day and underestimate the damage done by procrastinating for several years.

[^9]: You can't usually get paid for doing exactly what you want, especially early on. There are two options: get paid for doing work close to what you want and hope to push it closer, or get paid for doing something else entirely and do your own projects on the side. Both can work, but both have drawbacks: in the first approach your work is compromised by default, and in the second you have to fight to get time to do it.

### 6

[^10]: If you set your life up right, it will deliver the focus-relax cycle automatically. The perfect setup is an office you work in and that you walk to and from.

[^11]: There may be some very unworldly people who do great work without consciously trying to. If you want to expand this rule to cover that case, it becomes: Don't try to be anything except the best.

[^12]: This gets more complicated in work like acting, where the goal is to adopt a fake persona. But even here it's possible to be affected. Perhaps the rule in such fields should be to avoid *unintentional* affectation.

[^13]: It's safe to have beliefs that you treat as unquestionable if and only if they're also unfalsifiable. For example, it's safe to have the principle that everyone should be treated equally under the law, because a sentence with a "should" in it isn't really a statement about the world and is therefore hard to disprove. And if there's no evidence that could disprove one of your principles, there can't be any facts you'd need to ignore in order to preserve it.

[^14]: Affectation is easier to cure than intellectual dishonesty. Affectation is often a shortcoming of the young that burns off in time, while intellectual dishonesty is more of a character flaw.

[^15]: Obviously you don't have to be working at the exact moment you have the idea, but you'll probably have been working fairly recently.

[^16]: Some say psychoactive drugs have a similar effect. I'm skeptical, but also almost totally ignorant of their effects.

[^17]: For example you might give the nth most important topic (m-1)/m^n of your attention, for some m > 1. You couldn't allocate your attention so precisely, of course, but this at least gives an idea of a reasonable distribution.

[^18]: The principles defining a religion have to be mistaken. Otherwise anyone might adopt them, and there would be nothing to distinguish the adherents of the religion from everyone else.

[^19]: It might be a good exercise to try writing down a list of questions you wondered about in your youth. You might find you're now in a position to do something about some of them.

[^20]: The connection between originality and uncertainty causes a strange phenomenon: because the conventional-minded are more certain than the independent-minded, this tends to give them the upper hand in disputes, even though they're generally stupider.

> The best lack all conviction, while the worst
> Are full of passionate intensity.

[^21]: Derived from Linus Pauling's "If you want to have good ideas, you must have many ideas."

[^22]: Attacking a project as a "toy" is similar to attacking a statement as "inappropriate." It means that no more substantial criticism can be made to stick.

[^23]: One way to tell whether you're wasting time is to ask if you're producing or consuming. Writing computer games is less likely to be a waste of time than playing them, and playing games where you create something is less likely to be a waste of time than playing games where you don't.

[^24]: Another related advantage is that if you haven't said anything publicly yet, you won't be biased toward evidence that supports your earlier conclusions. With sufficient integrity you could achieve eternal youth in this respect, but few manage to. For most people, having previously published opinions has an effect similar to ideology, just in quantity 1.

[^25]: In the early 1630s Daniel Mytens made a painting of Henrietta Maria handing a laurel wreath to Charles I. Van Dyck then painted his own version to show how much better he was.

[^26]: I'm being deliberately vague about what a place is. As of this writing, being in the same physical place has advantages that are hard to duplicate, but that could change.

[^27]: This is false when the work the other people have to do is very constrained, as with SETI@home or Bitcoin. It may be possible to expand the area in which it's false by defining similarly restricted protocols with more freedom of action in the nodes.

[^28]: Corollary: Building something that enables people to go around intermediaries and engage directly with their audience is probably a good idea.

[^29]: It may be helpful always to walk or run the same route, because that frees attention for thinking. It feels that way to me, and there is some historical evidence for it.

## 译注

这篇文章是非常口语化的，译文也将顺延这一点，例子可见译注[^great work]、[^fractal]。

[^great work]: “great work”不会翻译成“伟业”，而是“干大事”。而且根据原作注释[^1]，“great work”的定义一般不明朗，衡量的标准也相当口语化，也很符合“大事”这个词。

[^long]: 部分原因是，这篇文章非常长

[^rubber]: 原文是舵，rubber

[^fractal]: 原文是“分形”（fractally），复杂系统的一个术语，出现在这篇口语化的文章，有点奇怪，故这里选择用一个经典例子替代——比例尺越小，海岸线长度越大，复杂度不变。分形常被用来描述一种无限复杂、但是在各个尺度上都表现出相似性的结构。这种分形结构可以看作是知识的象征。配图来源：[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Long_Is_the_Coast_of_Britain%3F_Statistical_Self-Similarity_and_Fractional_Dimension)

[^bud]: 原文是“分形芽”（fractal bud），这里沿用地图与海岸线的类比，避免突兀，详见[^fractal]

[^big target]: 大目标看起来有点怪，用概率论解释一下吧：尝试一件事的成功率是 1%，要尝试多少件这样的事情，成功概率才能达到70%？120次。多吗？但如果120次都没做到，或许做不成事情的时候，不应该怪自己运气不好。

[^not people]: 也就是暗示恋爱关系不能这样？

[^excitingness]: 原文是excitingness rule，其实就是指第一节开头三个标准之一——你对它有浓厚的兴趣

[^frauds]: 原文是 eminent frauds。"Eminent" 通常是指在某个领域里有着高度声望或者被广泛认可的。"Frauds" 则是指欺骗或者不真实的事物。所以 "eminent frauds" 可以被理解为一些被社会广泛接受或者赞扬，但实际上可能并不真实或者并不值得追求的观念或者理念。

[^upwind]: 原文是 staying upwind，应该是类比了飞机要逆风起飞，逆风提高空气流速，从而使飞机获得更大升力。但中文语境下很难理解，尤其是中文的顶风、逆风多含贬义，故意译为“顺势而为”。

[^just one]: 如果你有打游戏的朋友，那么应该懂"我就打一把"的梗；还有一些游戏想方设法让玩家天天上线……启动效应就有这样的魔力。

[^mo]: 原文是`Not that anyone using this m.o. would care`。`m.o.`是`Modus Operandi`，用来描述个人或组织的特定行事方式或风格。

> > 在这段话中，"choose late"的意思是“晚做选择”或者“迟做决定”。这里的上下文是关于决定从事什么工作的复杂过程。作者指出，由于你只有通过实际做某项工作才能了解它的真实情况，所以你可能需要花费数年的时间才能明白你是否喜欢这项工作或者你在这项工作上是否擅长。而在此期间，你无法从事并因此无法了解大部分其他类型的工作。所以，在最糟糕的情况下，你可能会在信息非常不完整的情况下，晚做出选择。这里的“晚做出选择”意味着你可能会在投入了大量时间和精力之后，才发现你可能更喜欢或更适合其他类型的工作。

> The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do.

> > 在这段话中，"have of the former"指的是对前一种形式的抱负（ambition）的拥有或占有。这里的"the former"指的是前文提到的两种形式的抱负中的第一种，即那种在对主题产生兴趣之前就存在的抱负。
> >
> > 所以，"the more you have of the former"的意思是“你越多地拥有那种在对主题产生兴趣之前就存在的抱负”。这句话的含义是，如果你的抱负主要是在对主题产生兴趣之前就已经存在的，那么决定要做什么就会更困难。这是因为这种抱负可能会导致你对许多不同的主题都有兴趣，而不是专注于一个特定的主题。
>
> 这样理解如何？对主题产生兴趣之前就产生抱负，这样的主题越多，选择哪个主题就越难
>
> > 你的理解是正确的。在这段话中，作者确实是在说，如果一个人在对某个主题产生兴趣之前就已经对它有了抱负（也就是说，他们对这个主题有了预设的期望或目标），那么他们可能会发现自己对许多不同的主题都有这样的抱负。这种情况下，选择专注于哪个主题，哪个领域，或者说决定要做什么，就会变得更加困难。因为他们可能会对许多不同的可能性感到兴趣，而不是只对一个特定的主题或领域感兴趣。
